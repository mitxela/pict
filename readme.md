# PICT Container

Deploy a local instance of [PICT](https://mitxela.com/pict) in a docker container. Useful for situations with unreliable internet.

For the PICT source code, look at the master branch.

It should be sufficient to clone the repo, run `./build-container.sh` and then `./start-dev.sh` but for more details and a tediously long explanation of our journey to contain it, see [mitxela.com/projects/pict_container](https://mitxela.com/projects/pict_container)
